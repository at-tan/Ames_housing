# Ames_housing_I
Linear regression modelling of the Ames housing dataset (2011), with the goal of predicting the house sale price. I used a log-linear model, and was guided by the hedonic pricing method to analysing house prices.

Dependent variable: log Sale Price

Explanatory variables: Age, GrLivArea, BaseLivArea, LowQualFinSF, GarageArea, LotArea, LotFrontage, Location, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Fireplaces, OverallQual, OverallCond, Amenities (dummy), RoadRail (dummy), TwoStorey (dummy), FlatContour (dummy), FlatRoof (dummy), Garage (dummy), CentralAirCond (dummy), ExcellentKitchen (dummy), Zoning_2 (dummy), Zoning_3 (dummy), Zoning_4 (dummy), and year dummies.

A description of the research methodology and model findings are presented in https://towardsdatascience.com/wrangling-through-dataland-modeling-house-prices-in-ames-iowa-75b9b4086c96?source=friends_link&sk=7f14e31c588decaa09a37bba51dd44d1
